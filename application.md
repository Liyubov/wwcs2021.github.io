Participating in the first round of applications will provide to a few selected applicants the possibility to obtain a partial reimbursement of their travel expenses sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

The travel reimbursement will cover public transportation fees up to CHF 200.- for participants coming from Europe (and outside of Switzerland) and up to CHF 500.- for participants coming from outside of Europe.

There is no guarantee that these travel funds will be provided to the selected participants, however a place at the workshop will be reserved for them.

Notification will be given about four months after the closing of the first round of applications.

Applicants not selected during the first call will have the possibility to automatically transfer their application to the second round by selecting the appropriate section of the application form.

<!--The application form is available at [this](www.google.com) website.-->

You will be asked to attach your CV in pdf format (max 5 pages, including a selection of your most relevant publications).
