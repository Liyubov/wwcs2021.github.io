## Céline Rozenblat

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/image/celroz.png" width="250" alt="Paris" class="center" /></p> <!--#height="300"-->

[Céline Rozenblat](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1048878&LanCode=37), is professor of Urban Geography at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland and president of the urban commission of the International Geographical Union (IGU). She studies systems of cities at European and world scales, multinational firm networks, inter-urban dynamics, comparative urban data, mapping and visualization of networks in geography, and spatial analysis. For several years she has worked on the relations between the evolution of multi-level urban processes and dynamics in city-system networks. To study these topics comparatively, she has built many databases on large European and worldwide cities and the networks they form. In particular, she has dealt since 1990 with databases on multinational firm networks and on city properties and evolution in a multi-dimensional and long temporal approach. Diachronic and dynamic studies supply materials to develop spatial and dynamic models and visualizations. She participated in European projects like ESPON FOCI 2008-2011, FP7 FET Insite (2011-2013) and Multiplex (2012-2016). She also participates to the EuropeAid project with China MEDIUM (2015-2019) on medium size cities in China and launched two projects LOGIICCS (FNS 2015-2018) and MEDIUM (SWISS-Conf. 2016-2018) on modeling Indian and Chinese cities’ integration in global networks of multinational firms and innovation.

[Simon DeDeo](http://santafe.edu/~simon) is a professor of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, and external faculty at the Santa Fe Institute. He leads the Laboratory for Social Minds, a cross-disciplinary group of data science researchers in the cognitive and social sciences. Recent work has studied question-answer dynamics, cultural evolution in the online alt-Right, identity encoding in British theater, inductive structures of mathematical proofs, and two hundred years of diaries from Russia.

## Fabiana Zollo

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/image/fabianazollo.jpg" width="400" alt="Paris" class="center" /></p>

[Fabiana Zollo](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/14075308), is assistant professor in the Dept. of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics and Research Fellow in the Center for the Humanities & Social Change at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. Her research investigates (mis)information spreading on online social media, with a special focus on the dynamics of polarization and intolerance, and the evolution of collective narratives.
She collected several papers on the topic, both with national and International co-authors. Her research outcomes have been included in the Global Risk Report 2017 of the World Economic Forum, widely covered by the media (among the others: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, Bloomberg View, The Guardian, Phys.org, El Pais) and disseminated internationally (Le Scienze, Pour La Science, Spektrum, Scientific American, Investigatión y Ciencia). She participated in European projects such as H2020 EU project QUEST "Quality and Effectiveness in Science and Technology Communication" (2019-2021) and "Overcoming Polarisation and Misinformation around Migration in Italy" in collaboration with London School of Economics (LSE) and Corriere della Sera (2017-2019).

## Claudio J. Tessone

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/image/claudiotessone.jpg" width="290" height="300" alt="Paris" class="center" /></p>

[Claudio J. Tessone](https://www.business.uzh.ch/en/research/professorships/networkscience/people/Prof.-Dr-Claudio-J.-Tessone.html) has an ongoing interest in the modelling of complex socio-economic and socio-technical systems by recourse of network science and complex systems approaches. This includes how the networks of interactions and intrinsic or acquired agent heterogeneity modify processes such as diffusion and assimilation of external influences. This kind of research encompasses a variety of contexts, ranging from advertisement adoption, to social influence, and game theoretic settings.
