Previously it was held in [Brussels](https://ai.vub.ac.be/complexity/), [Madrid](http://wwcs2016.altervista.org/wwcswordyversion/?doing_wp_cron=1557075926.8519909381866455078125), [Petnica](https://wwcs2017ed.wixsite.com/wwcs), [Utrecht](https://wwcs2018.github.io/) and [Zakopane](http://wwcs2019.org).


# What are complex systems?
A [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, diseases, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.

The study of complex systems calls for an interdisciplinary approach combining disciplines such as Biology, Computer Science, Data Science, Economics, Mathematics, Physics and Sociology.
